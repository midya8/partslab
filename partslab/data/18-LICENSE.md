Rendered grayscale digits, edited browser inputs and learned nonnegative
basis images in the audit are adaptations of this dataset. Credit remains with the dataset's authors. UCI and
the authors do not endorse this project, its models or its conclusions.

The data contain 64 numeric image-block counts and one numeric class label per
row, not private customer or employer data. Source documentation reports 43
writers: 30 contributed to training and a different 13 to test. Individual writer
IDs are not supplied in these files, so this project cannot independently audit
writer identities or form a writer-disjoint validation split within training.
